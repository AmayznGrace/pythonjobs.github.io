You will also get involved in a number of short-term research and development projects: where we help partners to understand the potential of open data through workshops, collaborative work and code. On a day-to-day basis you will be:   Writing code;   Reporting and responding to issues and fixing bugs;   Deploying software to live, staging and development environments;   Attending daily stand up meetings to prioritise work for the day;   Contributing to software development roadmaps;   Prioritising feature development;   Clarifying tasks within the team and with clients;   Working on updates to data standards and schema;   Monitoring the use of software, using a variety of tools;   Contributing to team meetings and the growth of the co-operative;   Some of the main technologies we currently work with include:   Programming language & frameworks: Python; Django; Javascript; Bash scripts.

In the last year, we also voted on making contributions to a number of open source projects, and to the Open Rights Group. Open Data Services operates an auto enrollment pension scheme with 3% employer contributions. If you have an existing pension scheme, we may be able to make contributions to that.

As a workers co-operative we operate as a values-driven business. We are building for the long-term: we are not controlled by shareholders seeking short-term gain. We operate in-line with global co-operative principles, and part of a global movement of co-operators.  Being a workers co-operative is also an experiment. We believe that much open data is a public good, and to sustain public goods we need strong foundations. We believe that co-operative models are an important part of that.  After a short probationary period, all employees are eligible to become a member of the co-operative, taking on an equal role in the ownership and governance of the business. We operate collective management, with regular online team meetings, and quarterly full-team meet-ups to make decisions about the projects, operations and direction of our shared work.  (Co-operative membership is optional. There is no obligation for employees to become a member, and all core employment benefits are shared equally amongst the team, whether members or not.)
