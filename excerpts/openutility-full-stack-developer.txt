Hello, we’re looking for a full stack developer, might this be you? Our vision is a world powered by renewable energy. Our mission is to give generators and energy users access and control of their own energy networks. We keep things simple, use the best tools for the job and collaborate with the right people to push boundaries and challenge the status quo. Our Peer-to-Peer Energy Marketplace is an easy way for energy users and renewable generators to buy and sell energy directly. We’re looking for a team member to help out with front-end and back-end development - are you interested in joining us? We’re an ambitious team of 7 based in London (and before you ask - yes we’re a totally cliché Shoreditch startup - but we like to joke about this down the pub with our pretentious pints of pale ale ;) ) We’re preparing to pilot Piclo, our peer-to-peer Energy Marketplace at the end of this year. The pilot has been part funded by the Department of Energy and Climate Change and involves working closely with Good Energy, our chosen licensed energy company (more about the pilot). Like all startups, every team member wears many hats so we’re looking for someone to be flexible (that’s one of our key values). We don’t expect you to be an expert at every skill we’ve listed below but we’d be looking for enthusiasm to learn and collaborate. Are you really confident in these skills:  Front-end development in HTML/CSS, and using Django templates. Python development. Our peer-to-peer engine is built in Python, so some experience with the language is helpful.  Are you interested in helping in these areas:  Continuous integration, with unit testing and behavioural testing. Going deeper with front-end - this may involve a JavaScript framework, as well as automating our front-end build process with tools such as Grunt, Gulp, and LESS. Analytics, helping us with our metrics and supporting our marketing.  How to apply for this role: Send us an email explaining why you think you’re the one and link us to your online portfolio. We’ll invite successful applicants for a 15 minute video skype chat (unsuccessful applicants will get an email informing them - we don’t leave people hanging). We’ll get you in to meet the team and complete some sort of coding challenge (to be decided once we’ve met) The successful candidate will be invited to join the team as soon as possible (there’s lots to do!) Please email jobs@openutility.com to apply, we’re looking forward to hearing from you. (No agents or recruiters please or we’ll be forced to write you an angry email - and we can be mean if you distract us from our work)
