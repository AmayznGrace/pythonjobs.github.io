Made.com are a successful ecommerce company with insane growth,  who are re-engineering for scale. To that end, we’re backing HTTP microservices as an integration strategy for a leaner, meaner service-oriented architecture. We’re looking for talented hackers to help build our new platform. We’re technology agnostic, but Python is our immediate language of choice.   You’re opinionated, motivated, and have top-notch OOP and TDD skills. You have some familiarity with Python and would like to write more of it. Ideally, you have experience with Docker and AWS, love functional programming, and would like to play with Go and Scala in a production environment. You have experience with writing and consuming hypermedia APIs and read the HttpBis specs for fun.    Experience with Hypermedia APIs, or event-driven services using a message bus. Excellent TDD and OO skills, experience of DDD a plus.
