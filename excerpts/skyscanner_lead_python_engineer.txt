We’re looking for an accomplished Python Engineer, who is willing to take calculated risks in order to deliver and make impact with their work. This role calls for an engineer who is not afraid of complex and challenging technical problems, such as those we’re solving every day at Skyscanner – an engineer who will make a difference through testing new ideas and by being brave enough to challenge those around you as you collaborate to develop our products and constantly work to improve what’s under the bonnet. If you’re someone who can make difficult decisions and take ownership of a problem from end to end, we’d love to hear from you. Skyscanner is a fast paced internet economy company in the travel business and over 30 million people a month trust us to turn their travel nightmares into sweet dreams.

The key to the success of this position is having strong and innovative approach to problem solving, great technical leadership, excellent communication skills, flexibility, and a self-motivated working style with attention to detail. Oh, and ‘impossible’ is not in your vocabulary.

A  Computer Science degree or similar; experience working in an internet economy or other tech environment Highly skilled in Python, JavaScript and HTML; ideally experience of familiarity with product engineering, software testing and database design techniques.
